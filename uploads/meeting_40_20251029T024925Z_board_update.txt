Quarterly Board Update — Transcript (abridged)
Date: 2025-10-16
Attendees: @ceo, @cfo, @pm_arul, @lead_shiva, @data_alex

Opening:
- Overview of Q3 goals, risks, and hiring plan.

Status:
- Revenue tracking slightly above plan; support tickets down 12%.
- Upload → Summarize → Store flow works; parsing for PDF/DOCX pending final tests.
- Pilot users want CSV/Markdown export of Key Points, Decisions, Action Items.

Discussion:
- We will prioritize export endpoints and a visible History panel for demos.
- Agreed to keep temperature low for consistency; retries will stay at 3.
- Concern: transcripts over 2 hours—consider chunking with overlap and warning banners.

Notes:
- @data_alex shared that VTT from Zoom is the most common format.
- Let's assign explicit owners to action items with due dates.

Decisions:
- Decided to cap uploads at 50 MB and show a warning on large files.
- We will expose GET /api/summaries/{id}/export.csv and /export.md.

Action Items:
- @lead_shiva implement CSV + Markdown export endpoints — due 2025-10-20
- @pm_arul add History list UI with version picker — due 2025-10-19
- @data_alex validate PDF/DOCX parsing on 5 real samples — deadline 2025-10-21
- Follow up with pilot users about chunking needs — by 2025-10-22

Closing:
- Next review on 2025-10-23; send notes to all attendees.
