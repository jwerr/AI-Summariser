Arul: Alright team, let’s start today’s sprint review. Shiva, how’s the backend refactor coming along?

Shiva: It’s done! The new caching layer reduced API response time by nearly 40%.

Alex: That’s great! I’ll test it with the new frontend build once you push the latest changes.

Steve: I’ve updated the landing page layout and improved the accessibility labels. We might need to test it again with screen readers.

Robert: I’ll take care of that. Also, for next week’s deployment, we should all **log in 20 minutes earlier** than usual to verify the staging environment before the client demo.

Arul: Excellent point, Robert. Let’s finalize that. Everyone, please be ready by 9:10 AM next Wednesday.

Steve: Got it.

Arul: Finally, let’s plan our **next team retrospective meeting two weeks from today — November 18th at 4 PM**. We’ll discuss sprint velocity and open issues.

Alex: Perfect. I’ll bring the GitHub issue summary and PR metrics.

Arul: Thanks, everyone. Great progress this sprint — keep it going!
