------------------------------------------------------------

10:00 AM — John:
Good morning, everyone! Let's get started. We have a packed agenda today: current sprint updates, the upcoming release, the issue Priya was working on, and the team lunch. Sound good?

10:00 AM — Alex:
Yep, let’s move fast today. I have another call at 11:15.

10:01 AM — Priya:
Sounds good.

10:01 AM — Arul:
All good.

10:02 AM — Michael:
Ready.

10:02 AM — Sarah:
Good to go.

------------------------------------------------------------
10:03 AM — John:
Alright, quick updates. Arul, you go first. How’s the API refactoring?

10:03 AM — Arul:
Yeah, so the refactor is about 80% done. The only pending part is integrating the new authentication middleware with the transcript upload endpoint. Should be done today by evening.

10:04 AM — Alex:
80%? Arul, last Friday you said you were almost done. What changed?

10:04 AM — Arul:
Yeah, I underestimated the merging conflicts with the dev branch. Priya’s UI changes affected some routes, so I had to rework the schema mapping.

10:05 AM — Alex:
(sighs) Okay… fine. Just make sure it doesn’t slip again. We can’t afford delays this sprint.

------------------------------------------------------------
10:05 AM — John:
Priya, your turn. How’s the Meeting Summary UI revamp?

10:06 AM — Priya:
About that… I’ve completed the new layout, search bar, and dark mode fixes. I still need to push the transcript viewer update. I’ll do it today.

10:06 AM — Alex:
Wait, what? You said transcript viewer would be done *yesterday*. QA already tested the old component!

10:07 AM — Priya:
I know, but I had to redo the modal because the design kept breaking in dark mode. And the Q&A bot placement needed adjustments.

10:07 AM — Alex:
Priya, we’ve talked about this. You keep starting multiple UI tasks at once and then delaying the critical ones. We needed the transcript viewer for testing this morning.

10:08 AM — Priya:
I didn’t “delay”—I was making sure it looks consistent! The old UI was a mess.

10:08 AM — Alex:
You could’ve pushed *something*. A partial implementation is better than no implementation.

10:09 AM — John:
Alright, okay—let’s not escalate. Priya, can you commit to finishing it today?

10:09 AM — Priya:
Yes, I will finish it today. I’ll pair with Arul if I need help with backend integration.

10:10 AM — Alex:
Good. Please prioritize properly. We're really cutting it close.

------------------------------------------------------------
10:11 AM — Sarah:
Um… small update from QA. The summarization job sometimes runs twice when the button is clicked quickly. We need a debounce or something.

10:11 AM — Arul:
Yeah I saw that. I’ll fix it by disabling the button until the job returns.

10:12 AM — Sarah:
Great, thank you!

------------------------------------------------------------
10:13 AM — John:
Michael, deployment pipeline status?

10:13 AM — Michael:
Everything’s on schedule. The staging pipeline is stable. I’m adding OpenAI key rotation automation today. Shouldn’t affect anyone.

10:14 AM — Alex:
Good. Push it once done; we need stable infra for next week’s demo.

------------------------------------------------------------
10:16 AM — John:
Now, upcoming release planning. Next week, we’re deploying:
- Transcript Upload Fixes (Arul)
- Transcript Viewer Modal (Priya)
- QA Bot Improvements (Alex + Arul)
- UI Theme System (Priya)
- Logging Expansion (Michael)

Anyone see any blockers?

10:17 AM — Priya:
I just need clarification on the “View Transcript” modal. Should we allow editing inside it?

10:17 AM — Alex:
No editing. Only viewing and downloading. Editing is out of scope and will break version control.

10:18 AM — Priya:
Okay got it.

------------------------------------------------------------
10:20 AM — John:
Alright, next topic—team lunch!  
We skipped it last month, so let’s actually plan it this time. Suggestions?

10:21 AM — Sarah:
Can we do Korean BBQ this time?

10:21 AM — Michael:
YES. Korean BBQ. Please.

10:22 AM — Priya:
I’m vegetarian 😭

10:22 AM — Alex:
Don’t worry, they have veg stuff too.

10:22 AM — Priya:
No they don’t. The last time everything smelled like meat.

10:23 AM — Arul:
We can also do Indian buffet. Everyone likes naan.

10:23 AM — Michael:
I like naan. I don’t know what half the other things are but naan is solid.

10:24 AM — Sarah:
🤣 Michael please.

10:24 AM — John:
Okay, how about next Friday? November 21st?

10:25 AM — Alex:
Works for me.

10:25 AM — Priya:
Works.

10:25 AM — Arul:
Yep.

10:26 AM — Michael:
As long as food exists, I’m fine.

10:26 AM — Sarah:
Same.

------------------------------------------------------------
10:28 AM — John:
Before we wrap, Priya and Alex—anything you two want to align on after the heated moment earlier?

10:29 AM — Priya:
(sighs) Yeah… It’s fine. I’ll focus on the transcript viewer today. I wasn’t avoiding it—I just wanted consistency.

10:30 AM — Alex:
I get it. I just need the critical tasks first. Let’s sync at 4 PM?

10:30 AM — Priya:
Okay.

------------------------------------------------------------
10:35 AM — John:
One last thing—Arul, can you add a toast notification after transcript upload? Users need confirmation.

10:36 AM — Arul:
Yeah, I’ll add that.

10:36 AM — Alex:
Also add a loading shimmer for the summary card when fetching.

10:37 AM — Arul:
Sure.

------------------------------------------------------------
10:40 AM — Sarah:
QA found one more issue—the “dark mode” text for timestamps on upload status is barely readable.

10:40 AM — Priya:
Oh I fixed that in my new theme. It’ll look better.

10:41 AM — Alex:
Please push that theme file today so frontend doesn’t break again.

10:41 AM — Priya:
Will do.

------------------------------------------------------------
10:50 AM — John:
Anything else before we close?

10:50 AM — Michael:
Yeah—should we add a “Help” page for the Q&A bot? People keep asking how to use it.

10:51 AM — Alex:
Good idea. Let’s add a tooltip for now, page later.

10:52 AM — Arul:
I can add a small info icon with instructions.

10:52 AM — John:
Perfect.

------------------------------------------------------------
10:58 AM — John:
Alright team, good meeting. Let’s push the major updates today. Ping me if anything blocks you.

10:59 AM — Priya:
Thanks everyone.

10:59 AM — Alex:
Later.

10:59 AM — Arul:
Bye!

10:59 AM — Sarah:
See ya.

11:00 AM — Michael:
Peace ✌️

------------------------------------------------------------
(End of Meeting)
