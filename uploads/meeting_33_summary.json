    "Manhattan Community Board 3: fancy new warnings. Manhattan Community Board 3: Okay, so I gave everybody but Clint co host ability so that you can see what the controls are. Is anybody not working on it, either a laptop or a desktop. Is anybody using like an iPad or anything like that. Manhattan Community Board 3: Everyone's got a laptop right so control should look probably similar to what I'm working on, on a desktop, but that might be the only place where we run into trouble here. Manhattan Community Board 3: The one functionality that you lose as a host or co host or one of the functionalities that he loses the ability to raise your hand. So that's why sometimes Susan isn't able to raise her hand or meetings and she's raising her hand on the screen. Manhattan Community Board 3: Because I made her co host Manhattan Community Board 3: And if she wants to speak. She has no other way of telling you. She wants to speak, other than raising your hand and hoping she sees you, or just interrupting the meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: So keep that in mind running the meetings. If you're making other people on your committee a co host in order for them to either take notes or help you run the meeting administrative Lee, they're going to lose the ability to raise their hand if they want to comment. Manhattan Community Board 3: Tim just joined us as well. Manhattan Community Board 3: Make him a co host well alright so Manhattan Community Board 3: Today we're going to send everybody the CB three login information that needs it for your meetings. Manhattan Community Board 3: Because you will have to login to the CB three account in order to start your meeting when you log into the account. So there's two ways to get into zoom Manhattan Community Board 3: You either just go to zoom.com which is the website or you open the zoom app on your desktop. If you go to zoom.com you actually have more functionality. Manhattan Community Board 3: For creating meetings and scheduling meetings that you do, just go through the zoom app. So I always suggest just to go through to zoom.com and login that way and then we'll start a meeting. It will then open the zoom app automatically for you. Manhattan Community Board 3: The other thing I wanted to remind everybody is Zoom just released a new update. So before you get on to another zoom meeting. Just make sure I think it's version 5.2 point four is the new version. So just make sure that that's the version you're working on. Manhattan Community Board 3: It doesn't automatically download on your desktop, you have to go into the settings on zoom and just Athan and say look for updates and then once you get the update it will download it for you. Manhattan Community Board 3: I just want to talk briefly about the difference between meetings and webinars so we're running all of our committee meetings. Manhattan Community Board 3: As under the meeting function of zoom, which means that everybody who wants to attend the meeting, whether they are a board member or a member of the public. Manhattan Community Board 3: Has the ability to use their video and use their audio. The biggest difference with a webinar, which is how we're running our full board meetings and our executive meetings, is that the Manhattan Community Board 3: People who are passionate people who are given the role of panelists, ie the board members. Manhattan Community Board 3: Have to be invited to the meeting and they get a special link to join the meeting, and they are the only ones that have the ability to show their face to search and use their video and use their audio. Manhattan Community Board 3: Everybody else members of the public just gets a separate link that lets them view the media. Manhattan Community Board 3: And that the host of the webinar. And I won't go too much into it because you guys won't be dealing with webinars. But whoever is hosting and managing the webinar administratively Manhattan Community Board 3: Can move people from the view only attendee portal to that panelist portal. So if they have more functionality or can momentarily make somebody who's an attendee Manhattan Community Board 3: Be able to speak and can unlock their microphone for them. So if you want to ask them a question or they want to jump in and say something you can allow that temporarily thought moving them into the panelists mode and giving them that functionality. Manhattan Community Board 3: Clint. Is there anything else I missed about meetings versus webinars. OK. Manhattan Community Board 3: The next thing I want to talk about is just the screen view. So for me, I found it very easy to run the meetings, if I have the screen. Manhattan Community Board 3: If I have three windows open the view of the videos of people's faces the participant window and the chat window. Manhattan Community Board 3: And we'll go into a little bit more those in detail. And it's easy, especially the participant window is that Manhattan Community Board 3: Best window to have open next to the the video screen because it gives you the quickest options, at least in my opinion, to be able to unmute people or kick people out if you need to or manage people. It also gives you Manhattan Community Board 3: The list of everybody who's raising their hand, and it does it in order, who raised their hand first. Manhattan Community Board 3: I think everybody knows this by now. But when you're in when you're looking at your screen. There's two modes. Manhattan Community Board 3: You should be something you should see something at the top of your screen that says speaker view or gallery view. And that's how you change the view. Manhattan Community Board 3: So if you like you're in gallery view which shows all the little boxes like the Brady Bunch. If you're in the speaker view and only shows you who's currently speaking at that time. Manhattan Community Board 3: And as a big picture and then a little scroll on the top of who else is also there. Manhattan Community Board 3: This is why it's important to keep everybody muted when they're not speaking, because depending on what we're recording and how we're recording different microphones, so if if Manhattan Community Board 3: Say, Linda is going over a resolution and Clint has his microphone open and coughs that cough is going to momentarily cause Clint camera to be captured and interrupt Linda speaking Manhattan Community Board 3: On the on the video record of the meeting. So usually we just keep everybody muted and have only the person who's actually speaking at the time. Manhattan Community Board 3: Open so that there's not a lot of open mikes. You're not picking up that Clint Smeltzer: One thing added that to the other thing. Not only does it interrupted video but it breaks up the transcription as well. Clint Smeltzer: For the record, the transcription recording that is broken up instead of a consistent line if someone's video cuts in it breaks up you're speaking into different lines for the transcription and makes it a lot more jumbled Manhattan Community Board 3: So I gave everybody, I believe, except Lisa Manhattan Community Board 3: There we go, now she has it everybody but Clint is given co host ability. So if you basically just move your mouse over the screen and for the photos along the bottom of your screen. All of the control should show up. Manhattan Community Board 3: So the first control for me. I'm going to go in order of what I see. If somebody is it, seeing what I see holler and let me know. Manhattan Community Board 3: So the first control all the way to the left is the mute microphone. It should have a little arrow next to it so Manhattan Community Board 3: The arrow, basically, if you click on that just shows you, there should be a checkmark next to whatever you're using as your audio source and whatever you are using as your speaker source so Manhattan Community Board 3: For instance, if you have somebody like Felicia Cruickshank who's had audio problems. The past couple of meetings. Manhattan Community Board 3: One of the ways you can troubleshoot with them is asking them to open up this arrow and see what's check to see what it is that they're supposed there because it could be that she's not joining the meeting correctly and she's not clicking the button that says join the meeting by audio. Manhattan Community Board 3: Instead of joining joining the meeting by phone. Manhattan Community Board 3: So this is a good place to look for, for those Manhattan Community Board 3: Types of things. This is also a quick and easy button to unmute yourself. So if you know if you want to meet yourself for any reason. If you're, you know, need a break from talking with somebody else to do it. Manhattan Community Board 3: Or if it's not your turn to talk. You can just click that and it turns into their red slash icon. The next one is the stop video button. Manhattan Community Board 3: So again, this one has an arrow next to it as well, which just tells you Manhattan Community Board 3: What you're using as your video source. It also gives you an option to choose a virtual background. If you want one. Manhattan Community Board 3: Some people find those fun. Some people if you don't have a green screen, you wind up looking like Megan looks right now. Manhattan Community Board 3: There's also in both the mute and stop video button, there's there's additional settings that you can open. I'm not going to go into those in more detail because once you start playing around with settings. It gets really complicated. Manhattan Community Board 3: Same thing with the mute button if you just click this video. If you click the icon to stop the video, it will turn your video off momentarily. Manhattan Community Board 3: So you've probably seen me do this in our longer meetings that usually means I even need to go get some more water or I need a bathroom break, and I don't want you to see me getting up so so for any reason you need to Manhattan Community Board 3: Just not want to be showing your video, you can just click Manhattan Community Board 3: That and Manhattan Community Board 3: Deal with it there. Manhattan Community Board 3: The second way. The thing about Zoom is that Manhattan Community Board 3: There's Manhattan Community Board 3: At least two if not three ways to do everything. Manhattan Community Board 3: So, the other way to mute yourself or stop your video is if you just hover over your picture on the screen. You're a little square, you'll see a little blue square, it shows up. It says in you and then three dots next to it. If you click on those three dots. Manhattan Community Board 3: There's something that says Manhattan Community Board 3: mute my audio stop video rename which we'll get into pin video, which means that whoever is video you pin that video is always going to be in your top left screen, no matter what. Manhattan Community Board 3: Spotlight video which we've never used or you can hide the selfie. So if you don't want to be looking at yourself. Manhattan Community Board 3: All the time as you're running a meeting, you can just hide your view so that you don't have to see it. Manhattan Community Board 3: The next icon on the bottom controls is the security icon. Manhattan Community Board 3: So if you open that you'll see the options are to lock the meeting. And this is where if Manhattan Community Board 3: We'll go into it a little bit later. More detail to if you get zoom bombed. This is one of the two places where you can lock the meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: What locking the meeting means that anybody with the code for the meeting won't be able to join it. You basically closing the meeting that Manhattan Community Board 3: We try not to do this because obviously we want the public to be able to join the meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: But the minute you think you get into zoom bomb. The first thing to do is to lock your meeting because what happens is that once zoom bomb refines active meeting they Manhattan Community Board 3: Transmit that code out to all the other two bombers and your meeting will start getting flooded. If anybody saw the SLA video that got June bomb. Do you all Manhattan Community Board 3: See what that looks like. Manhattan Community Board 3: Enable waiting room. So this is one of the you are all put into a waiting room tonight when you first came on. Manhattan Community Board 3: So this is a new for us. We started using the waiting room as a deterrent for zoom bombers because a lot of the literature. I've read about zoom meeting says that June bombers don't really like to sit in a waiting room, even for a minute. Manhattan Community Board 3: They just like to find an open meeting cause havoc and then get out of the meeting so Manhattan Community Board 3: we've enabled we've started the waiting room. Manhattan Community Board 3: So that basically if you see somebody joining the meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: And Manhattan Community Board 3: It's already halfway through, I odds are, it might not be a Manhattan Community Board 3: Somebody from the community. It might be assumed bomber. So you might just want to leave them. Manhattan Community Board 3: In the waiting room for a minute or two, and see if they stay there. Because if they're really somebody from the community, they're going to stay there and waiting to your left them in, or they're going to email and say, hey, I can't get in. I'm in the waiting room. Manhattan Community Board 3: To zoom bombers two bombers don't Manhattan Community Board 3: Join your meeting at the beginning. They're not like going to our website and getting the code and saying, Oh, I'm going to join this meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: They're basically entering in random sequences of numbers and seeing if there's a meeting going on. They can just start Manhattan Community Board 3: So at the very beginning of the meeting the odds are anybody in the waiting room is there for your meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: It's, you know, the people who might join a half an hour, an hour in that need to be a little suspicious of obviously what will happen when somebody joins the waiting room actually Clint. Do you want to Manhattan Community Board 3: Jump off and jump back in. We'll see if you wind up in the waiting room again. Manhattan Community Board 3: So basically what will happen is if you have the participants tab open are ready to participants window and you see the list of everybody who's in the meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: At the very top of that if somebody is trying to join the meeting a their name will pop up and it will say that during the waiting room and then you have to choose to admit them or not admit them. Manhattan Community Board 3: So does everybody see that Manhattan Community Board 3: There's one person who's waiting Clint smelter so again you just hover over his name. And there's the option to admit or remove so you just hit submit. Manhattan Community Board 3: And then in a couple of seconds you'll be back into the day Manhattan Community Board 3: Welcome back plant. Manhattan Community Board 3: The other options in here in the security tab are allowed to switch to share their screen, which we don't have checked at this time because the very first meeting we had people started sharing your screen, for some reason, I think they were just trying to play with the controls. Manhattan Community Board 3: But if you need to give if you need to give somebody else on your committee or a Manhattan Community Board 3: City representative, the ability to share their screen. The easiest way to do it is just to make them a co host of the meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: And I'll show you how to do that. Manhattan Community Board 3: And then there's the chat function is in here as well. So this is something new. And this is something that Manhattan Community Board 3: Will talk about at exact, but we have the ability to turn off the chat feature. So, we will talk about this in more detail because we're currently using the chat feature to get attendance. So I have an idea about how we can so get time is through the chat feature. And I turned it Manhattan Community Board 3: Off, Alex. Alexandra Militano: Is that per meeting. Can you do a per meeting as opposed to having to do it sort of system wide. Manhattan Community Board 3: There's two ways to do it. You can either. There's a setting in the in our there's an account settings for our account that turns it off for the whole account. Manhattan Community Board 3: But then want to shut it off just for this meeting, you would go into the security setting for that meeting and uncheck it and it will turn the chat feature off. Manhattan Community Board 3: The next one on that list is to remain themselves. So when Megan first joined. She was under her husband's name. Manhattan Community Board 3: She has the ability to change that and rename herself, because I've given her the permission to do so. The host can also rename people as well. I would rename Susan, a couple of times in meetings because she showed up as a weird thing. And I was just like, I'm going to send her name. Manhattan Community Board 3: And then the other checkbox in the Manhattan Community Board 3: Security tab is that giving the participants, the ability to unmute themselves. Manhattan Community Board 3: So again we leave this check because it's somewhat easier administratively to let people unmute unmute themselves when they need to talk. We're all adults, we can sort of handle this. Manhattan Community Board 3: Rather than the host to have to find somebody, especially in larger meetings. Don't give me that I roll in Asia. Manhattan Community Board 3: Dr meetings. I mean, if you as you're running your own meetings. If you think it's easier to do all the unmuted and muting yourself, feel free. But, you know, there's no right or wrong way to do this. This is my preferred way. Manhattan Community Board 3: And but if you want to check that nobody will be able to unmute themselves. You'll have to unmute Mae Lee: Oh. So, Michael, I have a question about that because, um, you know, in some versions. When you on, you know, because they assume they keep changing this. And so now in some versions like Mae Lee: You if you unmute someone, you have to ask them for permission to and then they have to do with themselves. So hopefully they do but in our version, we can still do whatever we like in terms of that. I mean, we can mute and unmute without them. We shooting them. Manhattan Community Board 3: The system gets wonky in that. So if I like Clint is muted right now if I try to unmute Clint, and he tries to unmute himself at the same time, like the synopsis is don't work. And then he gets locked and Manhattan Community Board 3: And then it becomes this weird thing of like, well, which one of us can actually unmute you now and it's usually the participants themselves can unmute themselves. Manhattan Community Board 3: And like I said, there's, there's two ways to do everything in, zoom. So I'll show you how to do muting and I'm muting Manhattan Community Board 3: Than the participants window as well. You don't have to go here to do it. It's much easier to do it. Participants window, but I just want to run through all the bottom controls as well. Alexandra Militano: So, can I ask while we have this security screen up when I had people who infiltrated by meeting was a lot to me and then systematically removing the participants to get rid of people Manhattan Community Board 3: Yes you lock the meeting. And then you remove the purchase MENTION THAT STUFF LAST THING, and the security tab. And again, is also a way to do that. Manhattan Community Board 3: In the participants window, which is why I always suggest to have the participants window open, because it's just an it's one less click that you have to do. If you're already have the participant. Jacky Wong: Question. And if we have a lot of participants, is it easy to find out who is the infiltrator or is it like difficult identify this person. Manhattan Community Board 3: I'll tell you what I do when I'm when I am running the zoom for a meeting is that I usually keep my view and speaker view because then I automatically see who the person is Manhattan Community Board 3: So that, because otherwise, if you're in gallery view. As you can see, there's like little like green highlighted box around me. I'm the one speaking now. Manhattan Community Board 3: You don't necessarily see that if you have a large meeting have to scroll through a whole bunch of windows to see all your participants. So for me, usually I keep my, my view in Manhattan Community Board 3: Speaker mode so I can see exactly who's talking. This also helps knowing who you need to mute because if the sudden something pops up, that's not supposed to. You can quickly just be like, oh, Manhattan Community Board 3: Because the other thing that the participants window does Manhattan Community Board 3: Is that it moves people around based on who spoke last it's not doing that now because we're all listed as Co host. Actually, it kind of is because Alex is on is right below me and Jackie's right below her. So like whoever speaks Ness gets thrown to the top of the list. Manhattan Community Board 3: So that helps as well, knowing who's, who's involved. Susan Stetzer: In my, on my security doesn't have anything about muting I have Susan Stetzer: Locked meeting waiting room share screen chat. Susan Stetzer: Rename and remove it doesn't have anything about muting Lisa Kaplan: Yeah, be too. Manhattan Community Board 3: So that might be one of the differences between being a host and a co host. So you wanna Clint Smeltzer: I think that might have to do. So that's been added and deleted from the last two updates. So I think it was added back in, in the last update. So you may Clint Smeltzer: You may want to check. I don't know if you can actually do it. Now if you pull up not your zoom meeting, but if you have still have the zoom app window open Clint Smeltzer: In the upper right hand corner there should be a little profile initial Clint Smeltzer: If you click on that there should be a check for updates. Clint Smeltzer: About three quarters of the way down in the list. Laryssa: Also, if I may say, I'm in gallery view right now as Co host. When I click on anyone's window. I do have the option in my version to unmute them in the top right of their window. Laryssa: So I may be on an older version, but that might be something you're seeing if you click on someone's window you can unmute them. Manhattan Community Board 3: Yeah, it might be like Clint said it's probably a. There are some slight differences between a host and CO host of what they can and cannot do. But I think it's more Manhattan Community Board 3: Version. They've been they've been going back and forth with some functionality. So again, Manhattan Community Board 3: Before you join your next meeting. Do that update and maybe Clint, can you type up how to do it and we can send it out to everybody because will send it to the full board also so that everyone has the latest version. Paul Rangel: Michael if you hover over their name you comes up on them as well. If you have one from our participants name. Paul Rangel: You can Paul Rangel: unmute them that way. Manhattan Community Board 3: Yeah, exactly. Manhattan Community Board 3: So the next icon is the participants icon and basically you just need to click this to Manhattan Community Board 3: Open the participants window. Manhattan Community Board 3: So when you have the testaments window open, you'll see basically a list of names. Manhattan Community Board 3: And right now, Clint is the only one that's not a co host so Clinton, the only one who can kind of abuse. Manhattan Community Board 3: So if you hover over Clinton name you see two blue squares. Manhattan Community Board 3: Appear one that says asked him to unmute and the other one that says more if you click More that's where you get all of these other options. You can either you can click chat to directly chat with Clint. Manhattan Community Board 3: So that nobody else sees it, although, as we all know, chats get downloaded even the private ones. Manhattan Community Board 3: You can stop his video you can spotlight his video. This is where you can either make him the host or make a co host. Keep in mind that Manhattan Community Board 3: There can only be one host of a meeting. So if you make somebody else a host you are giving up your ability as the host, but there can be Manhattan Community Board 3: As far as I know, an infinite amount of covers. So if you if you have somebody else that you want to be able to run the meeting with you or be able to share the screen or whatever, make them a co host Clint Smeltzer: I would Susan Stetzer: Say anything about making sense not there. Yet Clint Smeltzer: But I'll and one thing just to add to what Michael just said, just be careful because if you do give someone else a host position. You can't take it. You can't take it back from them, I think. Clint Smeltzer: They can probably transfer to you, but like if you're in a meeting and you give someone from the city that's presenting or someone else if you give them host position. Clint Smeltzer: Then when it's time for you to take the meeting back over again, you have to then have them. So just co host is always the best thing to do, instead of transferring host Manhattan Community Board 3: Susan what Manhattan Community Board 3: What are you seeing Susan Meghan Joye: Yeah, I don't see it either. Michael Manhattan Community Board 3: This Way or not. Manhattan Community Board 3: It might be so you're not seeing the ability to make somebody a co host Meghan Joye: Right. Manhattan Community Board 3: It may be because I'll have to check the Manhattan Community Board 3: The link that I sent you all with the the box of Manhattan Community Board 3: That checks off, who has the ability to do, why that might be one of the things that only the host has the ability to make somebody a co host Manhattan Community Board 3: And co host can't make somebody else a co host. So let me look into that and I will send out a correction. But I assume that's what it is. If none of you see it. Manhattan Community Board 3: Do you guys see the one that says allow record. Susan Stetzer: Yeah. Yes. Manhattan Community Board 3: Again, that is, you know, we record these meetings for our open law requirements, other people can reach to record them as well. But you can block them from they're not allowed, unless you give them the ability to do that. I don't see any reason why we would ever need that. Meghan Joye: So Michael, sorry to interrupt is so automatically nobody has the ability to record it individually and unless you give them explicit permission. Right. Manhattan Community Board 3: Yes, that's one of the overall settings in our, in our Manhattan Community Board 3: Login. Manhattan Community Board 3: And just a note about recording. I've already set up all the meetings to automatically record record to the iCloud. Manhattan Community Board 3: So, so if you're tinkering around tinkering around and settings and any point don't change any of the recording settings. The reason we record it to the iCloud instead of reporting it to your hard drive is because the Manhattan Community Board 3: Pre recorded to the iPod zoom will automatically transcribe the audio of the meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: That usually takes a day for us to get it but it's it's a lot more helpful with with the Secretary's need to do in minutes and attendance issues and stuff like that. So if you record it to your hard drive. We don't get the transcription. We only get the transcript and recording to Manhattan Community Board 3: The cloud. The other thing that you will see what you know what I don't want to jump ahead. So then you'll see the option to rename Manhattan Community Board 3: So again, this gets back to where it was in the security settings. So, you know, if for some reason, Clint joined under his husband's name or some other account, you can just click rename and type in whatever you want it. We want it to be. Manhattan Community Board 3: We can put them back in the waiting room if we want to. Or we can remove him. Like a timeout. Manhattan Community Board 3: Exactly. Manhattan Community Board 3: But again, so if you are getting zoom bond, you can, you know, you can quickly try to either put them back in the waiting room and then they'll probably leave again or just remove them from the meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: There is a another feature that's not here about reporting because it's somewhere else, which is stupid. Alexandra Militano: I have a question. So, Alexandra Militano: It looks like when I clicked on cleanse more he has a bigger list of things than you do. Alexandra Militano: Or like Alicia does. I'm just going to the pictures that are for me surrounding him Hall. Manhattan Community Board 3: Because we're all Manhattan Community Board 3: Because we're all co host Alexandra Militano: I movies, not Manhattan Community Board 3: Yeah, so that's why I left Clint as a participant so that we would see what it looks like for everybody else, like if I Alexandra Militano: Took the CO hosts. Here we have more limited Alexandra Militano: More limited option. Manhattan Community Board 3: Yeah, that's why I was saying earlier where when you make somebody a co Host You're limiting some of the things that they can do like raising their hand if they want to speak. That's one of the big things they lose busy man. Manhattan Community Board 3: But if you hover. If you hover over ANYBODY ELSE THAT IS A CO host, you'll see that you can just withdraw the CO host permission from them and then they just go right back to being a participant so Meghan Joye: I don't see that option either Manhattan Community Board 3: Oh, it's probably something the host can do so I'm gonna whose name is Alex. I'm going to withdraw your Manhattan Community Board 3: So now, Alex is mainly is just a participant. Alexandra Militano: And they still did the short list, which is different from well now clinches has two things. Meghan Joye: Now, you're, you're a long list for me. Alex Yeah. Alexandra Militano: So for myself I mature list that's Manhattan Community Board 3: Correct only has two things for you now because you and clicker at the same level you're both nice Alexandra Militano: Nicely. I can only do two things to Clint as opposed to like Manhattan Community Board 3: Whether you have no control over cleanse at this moment. Manhattan Community Board 3: But I will give you stability back, you can have more control over Clinton you'd like to Clint Smeltzer: So let me. I want to add one more thing before we move on for the renaming and I, I'm not sure if this would be useful for community meetings that we've used that I've used this and other meetings. Clint Smeltzer: The renaming if you want to segregate people into groups so that everyone is aware of it. Say you want to name someone the blue group. The Green Group, the red group for purposes of sorting them out and for people knowing who's in what Clint Smeltzer: Either you can have themselves rename themselves as something all consistent or you can rename them something all consistent just it's just an easy way of sorting people out. If you want to Clint Smeltzer: Separate them from for for some purpose that you would be using. I'm not sure what we've used it for work meetings for different groups, but it's just something to keep in mind. Manhattan Community Board 3: Yeah, like for instance. Alexandra Militano: Today, I'm sorry. Alexandra Militano: I was gonna say that's a good idea for our own full board meeting, so that people can see that we're part of the community board as opposed to, you know, everybody else. Meghan Joye: Yeah, and I committee meetings, you could put like you know chair or vice chair or whatever it is. Clint Smeltzer: Yeah, something like that money. Yeah. Manhattan Community Board 3: The other thing in the participants tab that you'll see is. So again, because everybody but Clint is listed as a co Host You should see three icons next year, name one is a little cloud recording thing and that means that you as a co host have the ability to stop and start the recording. Manhattan Community Board 3: And then you'll see the microphone icon and whether or not your microphone is on. It will either have the red flash direct or it will be a black Manhattan Community Board 3: Microphone, like if you look at mine or Alex's and then the video icon. So, like, if you look at Alicia's her video icon has a red slasher because she's not on video, she's just doing the audio so that's also another way to see how people have joined the meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: These little buttons down at the bottom, yes, no go slower go faster. We've never used those you Manhattan Community Board 3: Know I just started Alexandra Militano: I was thinking I should hit go faster. Go faster because that would be funny. Manhattan Community Board 3: Or yes, no, is, you know, again, because our meetings or public, there's no way to to tell who's voting. Either way, it's just it just, you know, if you click the yes no you'll just see like Manhattan Community Board 3: A checkmark next to my name or an x. Manhattan Community Board 3: Next to my name or whatever. So Manhattan Community Board 3: I mean, maybe for small meetings, people can use this to for small boats, but it's much easier to just do a roll call vote. We haven't used this at all. Susan Stetzer: So it won't be in the transcript. If you don't use it on That Manhattan Community Board 3: You can go faster go slower. It's basically just ways to tell, whoever speaking that you need me to go faster go slower. So maybe we should start using this for our elected officials, but Meghan Joye: Michael, sorry. I have a question. Meghan Joye: A lot of times we will do in our committee, like, Um, can I get a show of hands, who's ready to move on, you know, or who's ready to vote or something like that. Can we use the yes or no. For something like that, instead of doing a roll call. Manhattan Community Board 3: Yep. Okay. Or you can just, you can also, we haven't talked about the raise hand feature yet. You can also just do that as well. Have people raise their hands. Manhattan Community Board 3: Because again on the committee level, you'll know who the WHO, the members are so if somebody from the public is raising their hand or or voting, then you'll know you know to not include them. Manhattan Community Board 3: At the bottom again at the bottom, there's another more tab that basically has, you know, oh they added a dislike button. Manhattan Community Board 3: That basically has things that you can you know do to your it shows up on your video if you want to like something or something or say that you need a coffee break or or that you're away from your computer. Manhattan Community Board 3: And at the very bottom again, there's an invite tab. So if for some reason somebody is is Manhattan Community Board 3: Not able to find the meeting information. The easiest thing to do is just tell them, go to our website and all of our meetings are there, but you can click on the invite tab and Manhattan Community Board 3: It will open the meeting information and then you can either email them directly. Or you can just copy and paste it and send it to them. However, we wanted to that. Manhattan Community Board 3: I'm in here. You can also mute everybody Manhattan Community Board 3: That you want Manhattan Community Board 3: And then if you click the mute all button a pop up will come up that set that with a checkbox that says allow participants to unmute themselves if you uncheck that box. Then again, this is this the other the other way. Manhattan Community Board 3: That you can take that ability away from people to to allow them to unmute themselves. So we always leave the box checked so that they can unmute themselves. Manhattan Community Board 3: So then, next to that and very thing two or three small dots. Manhattan Community Board 3: If you click on those three dots. Manhattan Community Board 3: Again, this is Manhattan Community Board 3: Where we see the second place where you can lock the meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: Where you can enable the waiting room. Manhattan Community Board 3: Allowing participants to rename themselves unmute themselves more checkboxes to change settings. Again, that are in other places, but this is whether, click, click, a big get rid of the report feature. Manhattan Community Board 3: Muted Clint Smeltzer: It was under the security feature was where was the last time I had I used it. Manhattan Community Board 3: I think they got rid of it. What's interesting Clint Smeltzer: Is it there. I don't have it. Lisa Kaplan: It's in our version, we must have a older version where its scale. Meghan Joye: Yeah, no. Clint Smeltzer: I just I just updated mind. I think this morning. I think I got an email from from zoom to update and I now that you say that I'll look let me look at the email because it listed the things I think that was something that may, might have changed as well. Manhattan Community Board 3: Yeah I updated this morning, also. So anyway, we won't go into it. Then, but there used to be a way to report people who was your mommy. I'm so click. Do you want to raise your hand so people can see what that looks like today only one that can do it. Manhattan Community Board 3: Yeah, there we go. Alright. So when somebody raises their hand they automatically jump to the top of the participant list. Manhattan Community Board 3: And again, if we have multiple people raising their hand. It happens in the order that they did it. So usually, that's how I call on people, whoever raised their hand first. Manhattan Community Board 3: You can do it however you want to do it. Manhattan Community Board 3: So if you hover over Clint. Now you'll see that there's another option that says lower Manhattan Community Board 3: Hand. So as we were talking about earlier, when it was just a couple of us who were waiting for everyone else to join. Manhattan Community Board 3: When I helped Paul out for his competition meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: The one I basically just sat here and watch things and waited to see if as human bomb happened or whatever because Paul was had everything open that he needed to have open because he uses during the teeth so Manhattan Community Board 3: And the only thing he kept forgetting to do was lower people's hands so I kept doing it for him in the background. Manhattan Community Board 3: So again, when I'm not there. And you see everyone's hands raised. You'll realize, oh, I'm forgetting. Manhattan Community Board 3: So, Meghan Joye: Michael, you said this before, but we like I don't have the option to raise my hand because I'm a co host right now. Meghan Joye: Usually it's on the bottom of the participants screen. Manhattan Community Board 3: Yeah, yeah. You don't see it. If I take, and I can, I can take away some of the coast ability. A little later on. People can play with it again. But yeah. Manhattan Community Board 3: That's the, that's one of the biggest things that making somebody a co host loses is their ability to raise your hand. So again, you know, I know. I think for Manhattan Community Board 3: Us. We made Michael a co host and he couldn't raise his hand anymore. We did it for the Minutes and stuff like that. But he had to keep interrupting whenever he wanted to Clint Smeltzer: Say something. The one thing that co host can do is they can do the they can use the other reactions they can use the wave Clint Smeltzer: The wave of the hand and the thumbs up and thumbs down. I think so. I mean, maybe that's a way around it, too. If it's a co host and you see there any sign up, then that means they're raising their hand. Yeah. Manhattan Community Board 3: Does anybody have any other questions about participants screen before we move on to the next icon on the bottom controls. Manhattan Community Board 3: So the next icon on the bottom is the polls icon at least these for me may not be for you. Manhattan Community Board 3: But you will see it when when you log in as the community board because our account comes with that that feature we don't use that feature. So I'm not going to go into it at this point. But there is a polling feature and Manhattan Community Board 3: In the system. So, so the next one you should see is chat. So if you open the chat box you'll see there's already a messages near from Lisa Manhattan Community Board 3: The one biggest thing I want to say about the chat, because I make this mistake often is that Manhattan Community Board 3: You'll see at the bottom of the screen at the chat, where you can type in your message. It says to there's a pulldown menu there. So it's usually the top option is everyone, then you can also send a private chat to any of the participants listed in the meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: For whatever reason, the chat that that to box changes to whoever Manhattan Community Board 3: Least for me, sometimes it changes to whoever chatted last so sometimes I think I'm sending a chat to the whole group. And I'm actually sending it to Manhattan Community Board 3: Only Lisa because she was the one who chatted to last time. So just make sure if you are sending a chat out to the group that you have that selected as everyone Linda Jones: Must Michael. Is that something that gets disabled sometimes because I've seen where you can only chat to everyone. Manhattan Community Board 3: Yes. So that is a setting a default setting and in our overall account. Manhattan Community Board 3: That actually recently changed. So again, we can have a conversation out exactly when we talk about some functionality at our meetings to decide to disable that as well. Manhattan Community Board 3: Because there is a checkbox that I can just uncheck that says only allow the chat feature to be to everyone and not allow Manhattan Community Board 3: Private chats. Meghan Joye: And looks like if you click on those three little black dots to the right of where your messaging somebody, it gives you the option to participant can chat with no one host only everyone publicly for everyone publicly and privately. Manhattan Community Board 3: So we can change it there also. Manhattan Community Board 3: I've never saw this three dots, because they're so thanks thanks Megan. Manhattan Community Board 3: Again, this goes into zoom has two or three ways to do everything. Manhattan Community Board 3: So again, we're going to talk more about the chat feature at our executive meeting, there's really not much more to say about right now. The main reason we're using the chat feature is for attendance purposes for non board members. Manhattan Community Board 3: We've been opening every meeting asking non but board members to type their name and the affiliation that they have with the community group into the chat box and then using that for attendance. Manhattan Community Board 3: Because the chat box is is one of the three things that gets downloaded after the meeting happens Manhattan Community Board 3: So usually I'll type something in the chat box that says the same thing. Please type your name, but Manhattan Community Board 3: But again, we'll have a larger conversation about this exact so there's not a lot of functionality in the chat box to go over unless somebody has a question about something. Manhattan Community Board 3: The next one is the one that we use a lot which is the share screen. So again, this has a arrow next to it. So if you click on that arrow. You'll see it there. Manhattan Community Board 3: Least I see three things. One, it says one participant can share at a time. Manhattan Community Board 3: Or multiple participants can share simultaneously or advanced screen sharing settings. So I usually have mindset to one participant sharing at a time. Manhattan Community Board 3: If you need to share your screen for any reason you literally just click the green share your screen icon and then it will bring up a Manhattan Community Board 3: white box that has little boxes in it that basically has everything in your computer that's currently open. So usually what I try to do before meeting is have everything open that I know is going to be shared that night. Manhattan Community Board 3: Because it makes it a lot easier to share something Manhattan Community Board 3: The other thing to note. So when you when you do click that icon that brings up this box. You just clicked on whatever it is that you want to share. And you can either double click it, or you can hit share and then it stopped sharing the screen. Manhattan Community Board 3: So Allah. Can you all see the training agenda. Manhattan Community Board 3: And then the Manhattan Community Board 3: So just. The other thing to keep in mind is when you share screen the recording the video recording automatically only records the shared document and whoever's actively speaking Manhattan Community Board 3: So, and then the way I have it said is when I share the screen. Manhattan Community Board 3: The controls that are usually at the bottom. Go to the top. So just keep that in mind. You might want to play with this at some point, and she see where your controls. Go. It also closes the chat box and the participants window. So anytime you share the screen you have to reopen those Manhattan Community Board 3: And when you stop sharing, same thing. They disappear, and you have to reopen them. So just keep that in mind. Manhattan Community Board 3: So you can stop sharing at any point and it just goes back to the gallery view or whatever views you were last in Manhattan Community Board 3: The other thing about sharing the screen when you click on the option to share your screen, the big white box comes up again and you see basic Manhattan Community Board 3: And I'll show you this feature. We haven't used this feature. But if you click on advance. There is an option just to share a portion of your screen. So basically, if you click on that. Manhattan Community Board 3: It brings up this at least for me, it brings up like an orange box are and if I move that box around then that's all you get to see Manhattan Community Board 3: Whoever Manhattan Community Board 3: So again, you know, this might be something I'll probably start using in the future. So that, especially for the timer. Manhattan Community Board 3: With it takes up less space on the screen to share and you can literally once the box appears. You can move it anywhere you want. So you can just hover it over whatever it is that you want to share Manhattan Community Board 3: Anybody have questions about sharing screen. Manhattan Community Board 3: Nice little Clint Smeltzer: One little tip. So there's an option in there. You can share individual programs or you can share your entire screen. Clint Smeltzer: I find it's helpful. Like if you're having a meeting where you're gonna be sharing a lot of documents. Clint Smeltzer: It's easier to share your screen or your desktop, as opposed to individual documents because then you don't have to switch back and forth from sharing each program in each document. Clint Smeltzer: But if you're going to do that. Just make sure that you know you don't have your video playing in the background of something else or whatever, if you're sharing your whole screen. Clint Smeltzer: So just one, but it is if you're doing multiple documents. There's also what's really helpful is a whiteboard function which Clint Smeltzer: You know, again, I don't know if you're me if your committees, you would need it, but sometimes if you need a whiteboard, just to like sketch a circle and say where is that going to be. It's just something to keep in mind. Manhattan Community Board 3: What I'm mean, I taught myself this program when when you know the pandemic happen. So I would suggest to all of you. If you have your own accounts just log on one day. Manhattan Community Board 3: Create a meeting. That's literally just you and play with all the functionality and see what it does, because that's how I sort of taught myself how to use this so Manhattan Community Board 3: The last Manhattan Community Board 3: One second to last icon is the reactions icon. And again, this is where if you want to give a thumbs up or applause. This is where you can just quickly go through that. Manhattan Community Board 3: And then there's always a more tab. And so again, depending on what role you have like if you're just a participant, you probably won't have this tab, because this, this is Manhattan Community Board 3: The menu that gives you that gives you the option to stream on Facebook or stream it on YouTube, which we are not doing we're basically just taking the recording and posting it on YouTube, after the fact. This is also where you can pause and stop the recording as well. Manhattan Community Board 3: The other thing I want to talk about and that because I think we've covered everything in the list that I sent you guys Manhattan Community Board 3: But the other big thing that I want to talk about is when the meeting is over. Manhattan Community Board 3: You can't just if you're a host, you have to at the bottom of this, the toolbar, where all the controls are you have to click the end button if you don't click the Add button and you just x out of the program. It's going to think you're still going to meet at Manhattan Community Board 3: The end button is what ends the meeting for everybody. It kicks all the other participants out of the meeting, it stops the recording it stops all of that. What happens when you when you click the end button is you will automatically get a pop up. Manhattan Community Board 3: That is the chat box. The chat box downloads automatically right when the meeting has ended. Manhattan Community Board 3: You don't need to do anything with that you can delete it, because the chat box that that download also goes into the iCloud storage system. And that's where I get it from so don't worry about doing anything with that file. Once it pops up on your screen. You can just delete it. Susan Stetzer: Could end the meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: Only the host can enemy. Yeah, you're not see you're not seeing. Yeah. Only the host can end the meeting. That's one of the functionalities of the host. So it's right, it's literally at the end of that toolbar. Manhattan Community Board 3: There's a little bit of big bright red icon that says no, you have to end the meeting when the meeting is over. Linda Jones: That's the participant list. Skip. Linda Jones: logic that class you Manhattan Community Board 3: Know, unfortunately, that's why we can't use it for attendance and Manhattan Community Board 3: That's why we've been asking people to Manhattan Community Board 3: type their name into Linda Jones: Dynamic credit changes as people go in and out. Manhattan Community Board 3: Yeah. I mean, Manhattan Community Board 3: There is something you know Manhattan Community Board 3: Again, this is more of a conversation for our debt call but Manhattan Community Board 3: You know, one of the functionalities. We're not using is requiring people to register for our meetings. We're just leaving them open so that anybody can join them at any time. Manhattan Community Board 3: Some other community boards are using the registration feature. And that's another way to capture attendance. But again, that's a conversation for another time. Meghan Joye: I'm Meghan Joye: Michael, I don't, I don't see that in button is Manhattan Community Board 3: Because you're not only available to the host. So I would have to make you have to give you well. Clint Smeltzer: Michael does yours actually say end or does it say leave and when you click on leave, it says leave meeting for or and meeting for all or leave meeting is that does your say end or leave Clint Smeltzer: Boxes okay your says and but yeah Meghan Joye: I've got it. Manhattan Community Board 3: Yeah, so your lead but Manhattan Community Board 3: Me and if you're the host. If you're the CO host it just stays at least Manhattan Community Board 3: Any other technical questions that I can answer while you've got me. Manhattan Community Board 3: Soon, you're muted. Susan Stetzer: When Einstein assays. It's been absolutely great. I really appreciate it. Manhattan Community Board 3: No problem. Manhattan Community Board 3: So we're gonna take this recording, hopefully it worked out okay with all the interruptions and I'll put it on our YouTube account and not make it public. I'll just make it a private Manhattan Community Board 3: Video and then send everybody the link so that if there's questions, you can just refer back to the video right now, I am planning on being on economic development and health and human services, this week. Manhattan Community Board 3: Megan, I already talked about the possibility of me not being needed. So if it winds up, you know, an hour or so into the meeting that they're fine. I'll just drop off. Meghan Joye: Yeah, I think, I take that back. Now I know Meghan Joye: Like you for the beginning more detail than I expected. Linda Jones: But one thing I've noticed is even if Linda Jones: You have a small meeting like you helped with landmarks last time. Linda Jones: Basically somebody running the meeting, who's not chairing the meeting. And it's a big meeting like land use that's essential so Manhattan Community Board 3: you're muted. Again, Linda. Linda Jones: That way. Okay. So, for example, as the Vice Chair, I might run the meeting host the meeting. Well, Jackie chairs to meeting so that he doesn't have to worry about the technicalities and that was very helpful, even for a small meeting to have you doing that for me. Clint Smeltzer: Though it is very hard. It's hard to Clint Smeltzer: Run the meeting in terms of Clint Smeltzer: You know chairing the meeting. Clint Smeltzer: And running the meeting. Clint Smeltzer: Technically, because you're, you have to be looking at multiple things. So you definitely need to at least you know two people to to handle it. Mae Lee: Yeah, I also would feel more comfortable if you were there. Michael and Mae Lee: The beginning, I mean, I actually teach using zoom, but I still feel more comfortable because this will be our first time and first time for the other committee members and I have a large committee. Manhattan Community Board 3: I've already planned on it. So, you know, I think, again, we can speak offline with the other chairs. But I think Linda and Paul are probably okay on their own this month. Manhattan Community Board 3: Jackie may or may not be depending on what's on his agenda, but we can take it on a case by case basis, as far as who Manhattan Community Board 3: Who would like Manhattan Community Board 3: Even though you're there to help them out. Laryssa: Yeah, Michael, I have also I've worked with zoom a lot. I actually taught people to use zoom. And one thing I do is I co host for a few professors Laryssa: Which is very helpful for them. So I kind of pilot it for them checking the chat raising and lowering hands using and I'm muting Laryssa: That way it frees up the chair or the professor that case to run the meeting. So you're not distracted and you don't forget people and forget to call on them. It's very helpful to people like Manhattan Community Board 3: Susan you're muted. If you're talking Manhattan Community Board 3: That Manhattan Community Board 3: Hit your hit your red icon on your mouse. Manhattan Community Board 3: So technical difficulties so right now. Susan has an ass. Susan Stetzer: I did it by clicking my red thing. I'm not a little box. So what I was gonna say is we could put this video under member resources on our websites and be easier for people to find Manhattan Community Board 3: Okay. Yeah, I will. When I download it tomorrow, I'll send the link to gym. Once it's on YouTube and you can put it there. Susan Stetzer: Great, thank you. Manhattan Community Board 3: Awesome, Louis, or you have to email me and tell me how I did since you've done this before. Laryssa: I give you two thumbs up, but I can only do once I'm up in the reactions. So Laryssa: Here you go. Clint Smeltzer: One other thing, and I took this from Linda. Linda had put this together for her meeting. So I took it and modified it a little bit. I know I sent it to Michael, it's just a little kind of Clint Smeltzer: Introduction for the beginning of the meeting for the participants on how to use zoom Clint Smeltzer: It might be good. I think if we all put that up just to go through the beginning the meeting. This is how we're in the meeting. If you need if we're going to call on you to speak. This is how you do it just because there's still some people that haven't use zoom. So Manhattan Community Board 3: Yeah. And one of the I've been using that as well. We we stole it from Linda and made it generic and Manhattan Community Board 3: And I think I had it up at for policy meeting at the very beginning before we started the actual business portion of the meeting. So I'll do that for the other two meetings this week. Manhattan Community Board 3: The one thing we didn't really touch on are the people who are joining by phone online. And I think that you've, you've probably heard me say it enough that people on the phone. Manhattan Community Board 3: They have to either hit Start they have to hit star six if they want to mute or unmute themselves and star nine if they want to raise their hand what you might see Manhattan Community Board 3: And this happens a lot with Dave Adams, for instance, because, Dave. Manhattan Community Board 3: Despite my best efforts of getting giving him a webcam. He couldn't connect it to his computer and so he joins both ways. He joins the video call so that he can see everything and see the screen share. And then he joined by the phone so he can talk Manhattan Community Board 3: So you see in your participant list. Somebody listed twice. Manhattan Community Board 3: And it's a problem going both ways. Clint Smeltzer: So there is an option. And I don't know if you want to put the effort into helping them. But if you joined by you join with the computer screen and then you join with that when you go to the join with the phone. Clint Smeltzer: When you enter that in. It gives you a participant code it merges your phone number with your video screen so you won't have to I. It's not. I don't know how much effort we want to put into instructing them to do that. Clint Smeltzer: To clear out the parts but it's, it's an option. Clint Smeltzer: If you're with someone, personally, and you want to teach them, but otherwise to intermediate try and have them do that. It's Manhattan Community Board 3: A lot more that it's a little too technical. I think for them but but I will say that normally what I do is when I see people joined by phone only Manhattan Community Board 3: Is before the meeting the business part of the meeting starts is out say because you only see the last like the first three digits in the last three gets the phone number. Manhattan Community Board 3: So you see, I'll say, hey, Manhattan Community Board 3: Whoever joined us from 917 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You know 246 can you unmute yourselves and identify yourself so we Manhattan Community Board 3: Know, Clint Smeltzer: And then I change the other option you used to be as a host able to join. Clint Smeltzer: Us to be able to merge someone with the call. I don't know if they took that away. I think they did and brought it back, but as a host you used to be able to, I don't know if he still can. Manhattan Community Board 3: We'll see what happens the next time it happens. But just be just be again aware that you might see somebody's name twice, and it's father to join the meeting twice. I'll ask you the question. Alexandra Militano: Well, I was gonna say i i will say, I've had in German success with the the audio using my computer and zoom. So sometimes people don't completely hear me maybe my wireless connection. Alexandra Militano: So, Clint and I set up. I mean, Clint is a great resource. And I'm glad to have him as my vice chair so we sit in advance of our meetings I do the audio. Alexandra Militano: On my phone and I do the video on my zoom. So I can ensure that I have, you know, no issues with respect. Anybody hearing me while I'm chairing the meeting. Meghan Joye: Michael, just one last question. So if I'm, if I have a speaker coming to the meeting and I know how to unmute every are to mute everybody so that they're not interrupting him with questions while he's speaking Meghan Joye: So, but in order to get him to speak and be unmuted. I just have to hover over his face and click on mute, right, then everyone else's muted and he's not muted and they have to raise their hands if they want to be called on. Exactly. Manhattan Community Board 3: Again, if we're leaving that the option for people to unmute themselves that somebody could theoretically unmute themselves and be disruptive, but that knock on wood has not really been the case so far. Most of our meetings. Meghan Joye: And we can preface it like if you have enough saved questions to the end and use them and feature. Clint Smeltzer: Okay, so I just joined by phone, Michael just test it and see is as the host. Can you merge. If you right click on that does give you the option to merge with video Manhattan Community Board 3: Oh, it just get the option to rename put you back in the waiting room or remove Clint Smeltzer: Yeah, I think they remove that it used to be an option. But anyways, I was just testing it. Manhattan Community Board 3: Thanks for the test, though. Manhattan Community Board 3: The other thing also that Megan's question brought up for me is that, again, if you are having a presenter. Manhattan Community Board 3: I found the easiest way to do it is just have them join the meeting as a participant and then make them a co host once during the meeting. Manhattan Community Board 3: There is a way to make somebody a co host in advance by putting their email address into a co host box in the meeting setup. But the problem is that email address has to be associated with their zoom account. Manhattan Community Board 3: And for most city officials their city email is not the one they're using for their zoom accounts. Manhattan Community Board 3: So if you try to put an email address in that box to make somebody a co host in advance, you'll get an error message that basically says this email address does not have the zoom account associated with it. Manhattan Community Board 3: So that so but once somebody is in the meeting. You can make them a co host and regardless of whether or not you know they have an account. Manhattan Community Board 3: Any other questions. Manhattan Community Board 3: All right. Good night, everybody. Good. Laryssa: Night everyone she Lisa Kaplan: Really was Meghan Joye: Very helpful. Yeah. Laryssa: Great job. Thanks."
