# AI-Summariser
In most meetings, people talk about many things, but not everything gets remembered. Important points, action items, or deadlines often get lost. Right now, people either take notes manually or rewatch long recordings, which wastes time. 

# Zoom Meeting Summarizer – Team 5
**Clark University – MSCS 3999 Capstone Project**

## 🚀 Project Overview
The Zoom Meeting Summarizer is a web application that automatically ingests meeting transcripts (via Zoom or manual upload) and generates:
- Structured summaries  
- Action items & deadlines  
- Google Calendar event suggestions  
- Q&A chatbot with transcript citations  
- Notifications when summaries are ready  

This helps teams save time, remember decisions, and stay organized.

⚡ Do you also want me to **create the initial `requirements.txt` and `package.json` placeholders** (so the repo looks more complete before coding starts)?
